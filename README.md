# SummaAi Website

Welcome to the SummaAi website! This platform leverages the powerful capabilities of GPT-4, the latest iteration of OpenAI's advanced language model, to provide you with concise and accurate summaries of articles. With SummaAi, you can save time and get the key information from various sources without having to read the entire article.

## How it Works

SummaAi utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to generate summaries. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Input**: You provide the URL or text of an article you want to summarize.
2. **Preprocessing**: The article is cleaned and prepared for the summarization process. HTML tags and unnecessary formatting are removed to focus solely on the article's content.
3. **Summarization**: GPT-4, our powerful language model, reads and analyzes the article to generate a concise and coherent summary.
4. **Output**: The summary is presented to you in a user-friendly format, highlighting the most important points of the article.
